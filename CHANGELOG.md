# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.1.1] - 2024-04-02

### Added
- The GT encoding now follows a custom order for the genotypes. Both 0/1 and 1/0 are represented in the same order: Ref/Alt. 0/0 is represented as Ref/Ref, and 1/1 is represented as Alt/Alt.
- Users now have the option to switch between the desired genotype encoding by using the "use_GT_from_PED" input flag. By setting "use_GT_from_PED" to true, the genotype encoding will be sourced from the PED file generated by Plink software.

## [1.0.1] - 2024-03-28

### Added
- Added support for genotype encoding using PLINK2 software
- The python script now has an optional --ped argument. If supplied, genotypes will be sourced from this file. Otherwise, genotypes will be extracted from the VCF file.

## [1.0.0] - 2024-03-27

### Added
- Initial release
